# Customers & Orders 
This is a RESTful API project, that is also hosted on Azure _(utilizing the API Managment Service)_

Things I'll follow/implement are:
- ✔ Three layer architecture;
- ✔ RESTful;
- ✔ Dependency Injection (DI) patterns and techniques;
- ✔ SOLID;
- ✔ Repository Pattern;
- ✔ Fixed WIndow rate limiting strategy (implemented via Azure)
- ✔ JWT Auth 
- ✔ Unit Testing
