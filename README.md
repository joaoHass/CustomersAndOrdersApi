# What's this repo about?

This is a RESTful API project, that is also hosted on Azure _(utilizing the API Managment Service)_, that I've created to practice what I already know and to test new things.

Things I'll follow/implement are:
- Three layer architecture;
- RESTful;
- Dependency Injection (DI) patterns and techniques;
- SOLID;
- Repository Pattern;
- Fixed WIndow rate limiting strategy (implemented via Azure)
- JWT Auth 
- Unit Testing

I don't plan for now making this project complex (i.e adding a lot of classes, etc), as the purpose of it is to practice more broader and abstract themes (i.e software architecture).
